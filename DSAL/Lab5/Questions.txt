1. Write a program to reverse a singly linked list (implement both iterative and recursive methods).
2. Write a program to search for a given element in a linked list and print its position.
3. Create a singly linked list of n nodes and display all its elements.
4. Write a program to detect whether a linked list contains a loop using Floyd’s Cycle Detection
Algorithm.
5. Implement insertion operations in a singly linked list to insert a node:
• At the beginning
• At the end
• At a given position
6. Write a program to count and display the total number of nodes present in a linked list.
7. Write a program to merge two sorted linked lists into one sorted linked list.
8. Delete nodes from a singly linked list from:
• The beginning
• The end
• A given position
9. Find and print the middle element of a linked list using the two-pointer technique.
10. Remove duplicate elements from a sorted linked list so that each element appears only once.
